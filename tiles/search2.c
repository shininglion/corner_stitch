 * Applies the given procedure to all tiles found.  The procedure

 * THIS PROCEDURE IS OBSOLETE EXCEPT FOR THE SUBCELL PLANE.  USE
 * DBSrPaintArea() IF YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR PAINT TILES.
 *
 * Results:
 *	0 is returned if the search completed normally.  1 is returned
 *	if it aborted.
 *
 * Side effects:
 *	Whatever side effects result from application of the
 *	supplied procedure.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *	The procedure called is free to do anything it wishes to tiles
 *	which have already been visited in the area search, but it must
 *	not affect anything about tiles not visited other than possibly
 *	corner stitches to tiles already visited.
