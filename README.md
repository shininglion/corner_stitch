This program provides the basic operations of a corner stitch structure.
Some of the codes are reproduced from Magic VLSI Layout Tool:

Note:
corner stitch structure is proposed in the following paper:
John K. Ousterhout, "Corner Stitching: A Data-Structuring Technique for VLSI Layout Tools," In IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD), issue 1, volum 3, pp. 87-100, Jan., 1987.
